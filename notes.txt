Provide a memento interface on top of wald:data?

wald:past


Write interface
---------------

The storage server allows making changes to the dataset.  A series of changes is itself a separate
append-only dataset.  Each change should be described using the
[changeset](http://vocab.org/changeset/schema.html) vocabulary.  You can submit a set of changes
as a POST request to the collection of edits at /edits/.

Example changeset: http://tinyurl.com/kyzxmwt


Read interface
--------------

The read interface exposes two datasets, /edits/ and /dataset/.

Both datasets are exposed using a Linked Data Fragments server:

https://github.com/LinkedDataFragments/Server.js


Multiple databases
------------------

wald-storage can host multiple databases, each database consists of the dataset itself and the
history of changes (the associated edits dataset).  If you for example run a videogame website
you may want to stare videogame data in a dataset and store your user profiles in a separate
dataset, resulting on these backend base URLs:

    https://example.com/games/edits/
    https://example.com/games/dataset/

    https://example.com/users/edits/
    https://example.com/users/dataset/
